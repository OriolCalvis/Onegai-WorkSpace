/**
 * AuthorAgent Writing Stats Store
 *
 * Minimal, additive, per-day word tally used to power the "Author HQ"
 * dashboard (today/week/total words, streaks). This does NOT replace
 * HeartbeatService's in-memory today/streak counters (still used for
 * Morning Briefing + reminder milestones) — it exists because heartbeat's
 * counters reset on process restart and only ever know about "today".
 *
 * Design goals:
 *  - Never throw. Every public method swallows its own errors so a store
 *    hiccup can NEVER break the step-completion write path that calls
 *    HeartbeatService.addWords() (see heartbeat.ts).
 *  - Debounced + atomic writes (write to .tmp, then rename), matching the
 *    convention used by Vault.save() and GoalsService.schedulePersist().
 *  - Small and dependency-free: one JSON file, one Map of date -> words.
